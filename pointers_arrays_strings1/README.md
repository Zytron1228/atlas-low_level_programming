# readme C Pointers, arrays, and strings. Everything here has been copied over into this directory so that I can keep files seperate between the 3 projects, even though the intranet requires the same directory name as the last project did. (This doesn't cause an issue because I've finished the last project, so it won't need to check for these files, and if it ever does, I can just move them back.)

# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

I separated these into 3 directories to help keep organized and not get confused
while doing them. I had to keep my files for each project in a directory with this
one's name in order to check them, but once I was done with each project, I renamed
the project, adding a 1, 2, or 3, and kept the 3 directories separate.

Now that I am well past this, I've decided to move all three to this new directory,
to help with organization. Because when it comes to organization for me, it's always
either all or nothing.

I thought about adding directories for PP1000, PP1100, and so on, as well one as
for each sprint, but I'd still have to keep everything from the current project
outside of these directories, so I've decided against it for now. I might do
this once we move on to a new repository, which might be the start of T2.

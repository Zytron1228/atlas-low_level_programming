# readme Even More C Pointers, Arrays, and Strings.
This 3rd project on this topic covers a lot of messing with memory using pointers, arrays,
and character arrays (strings). I would like to thank my [programming music playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT3OMxC_4XmiPXQhDGDXLcpXbYJcI2d1Q)
for helping me stay relatively focused on this project while working from home.
